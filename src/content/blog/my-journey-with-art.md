  My struggle to bring back art into my life
---

Art has always been a part of my life, but my journey with it has been anything but smooth. Still trying to get a meaning of what art means to me, it has been a rollcoaster of emotions, challenges, and growth.

## The Early Days: A Therapy
This is where my mother's account came handy. I showed signs of ADHD when I was younger to the point being called mentally challenged behind my parent's back.

Mother took this challenge into her own hands. She bought paper and crayons. She made a circle with the black and told me to colour it.

My first attempts were shaky with frustration. The colour was all over the place outside the circle. With immense patience, she taught me to colour slowly, then, colour inside the circle. Then she gave me different shapes to colour.

Gradually, this changed to her teaching me how to draw a pair of lotuses. 

That was the only thing I knew how to draw. Surprisingly this even got me a bronze medal for my art contest in school.

## Falling in Love: In Too Deep
School let me express myself in different mediums - oil pastels, plastic crayons, water colors, etc. Though what was taught was pretty basic but the teachers motivated us all to experiment.

I drew pretty flowers, towering buildings, scenic landscapes...until I discovered anime.
Cartooning and Anime became the it thing for me, way before it became cool for the youngsters. I laugh as I reminescence the pages I have filled with my favourite characers in different action poses, replication of wallpapers, creating your own fanfic comics.

And as I started University, it was watercolours and I thought I got my niche finally. Got introduced to professional graphic design, also not leaving engineering drawing that I had to take up as a mandatory course.

## The Struggles: Overcoming Self-Doubt
One of the biggest challenges I faced in my life were trauma. Trama was due to people looking down on me; infact ignoring me for more than an year, the reason I will never know but I couldn't get my work done. 

It was frustrating, holding my pencil for long time with no result or even a rough sketch on paper.

Then I got hit by another blow, my father suddenly felt ill and didn't have much time to live. That too took a toll on my health. 

When I tried my best to recover and thought of doing art as therapy, nothing came from the mind. I couldn't create anything at all.

I faced self-doubt. I started questioning and crying myself to sleep. I couldn't do anything. I saw failure.

## The Present: A Continuous Journey
I did came out and I got struck yet again. But this time, I am not giving up so easily. 

I have slowed down. Giving enough time to forgive myself. Let that pencil sketch finish in two or even three days if it takes so, but complete that sketch. 

Today, I see my art as a journey. It tells the story of my struggles, growth, and the countless hours of dedication. While I still face challenges, I have learned to embrace them as part of the process. Art has taught me patience, resilience, and the importance of staying true to oneself.
