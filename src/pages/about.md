Hello and welcome to my personal blog!

I'm Sheetal Naik, a curious soul by nature. I currently live in Bhubaneswar, Odisha, India, where the blend of tradition and modernity inspires me everyday.

Front-end developer by profession. When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring me about all life's eccentricites.

## My Journey
My journey into web development started when I started exploring design and got into my first job as a UI developer. Over these few years, I've honed my skills in Javascript, React JS and other front end technologies. Also reading extensively about design in general.
I came to a realization that I was not growing at my workplace; neither skill wise and neither monetary wise. So I took a backseat and temporarily quit my job and being slow and serene.

## Beyond the Screen
Outside of my professional life, I’m an avid traveler and a foodie at heart. I love discovering new cultures and cuisines, and I believe that every place has a story to tell. Whether it’s a bustling city or a quiet village, I find joy in the little things and the unique experiences each destination offers.

## Why I Started This Blog
This blog is a reflection of my journey, both personal and professional. I wanted a space where I could share my thoughts, experiences, and the lessons I’ve learned along the way. From coding tutorials and tech tips to travel stories and personal reflections, this blog is a blend of all the things I’m passionate about.

Special thanks to [Sat Naing](https://satnaing.dev) for this wonderful template, it's minimal and content driven just the way I wanted.

I’m always eager to connect with like-minded individuals. Whether you have questions, feedback, or just want to chat, feel free to reach out to me through [your preferred contact method, e.g., email, LinkedIn, Twitter]. Let’s share our stories and learn from each other!
